# Data Discovery & Dictionary ‚Äî `thelook_ecommerce`

*Dataset:* `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce`  
*Purpose:* Synthetic e-commerce dataset modeling users, purchases, inventory, product catalog, and web events. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## üß≠ Overview & Business Context

This dataset simulates an e-commerce fashion retailer. It captures customer behavior from site events through orders and inventory. It can be used to explore typical analytics and data science problems: sales performance, churn, product recommendations, funnel analysis, customer segmentation, returns analysis, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Below is a high-level conceptual flow:
users ‚Üí events ‚Üí orders ‚Üí order_items ‚Üí inventory / products ‚Üí (distribution_centers)


Customers browse (events), place orders, order items link to products/inventory, and distribution centers / logistics help model delivery and returns.

## üì¶ Tables & Key Entities

Below is a listing of the main tables, a description, and example key columns. Use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` or BigQuery console to confirm full schemas.

| Table | Description | Key Columns / Relationships | Notes / Use Cases |
|---|---|---|---|
| **users** | Customer profile data | `id` (PK), `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `gender`, `age`, `country`, `city`, `created_at`, `traffic_source`, `latitude`, `longitude` | Use this as **dimension** for customer segmentation, demographics, geospatial joins |
| **products** | Product catalog | `id` (PK), `name`, `brand`, `category`, `price`, `cost`, `created_at`, `updated_at` | Product attributes, for joining in sales, recommendation, margin analysis |
| **orders** | Order-level metadata | `order_id` (PK), `user_id` (FK ‚Üí users.id), `status`, `created_at`, `shipped_at`, `delivered_at`, `num_items` | Use for order funnels, order lifecycle, cancellations/returns |
| **order_items** | Line items per order | `order_item_id` (PK), `order_id` (FK ‚Üí orders), `product_id` (FK ‚Üí products), `sale_price`, `quantity`, `status`, `inventory_item_id` | Useful for aggregations (revenue, units sold), linking to inventory, returns, order splits |
| **inventory_items** | Inventory / stock of product across warehouses | `id` (PK), `product_id` (FK ‚Üí products), `warehouse_id`, `created_at`, `sold_at`, `distribution_center_id` | To track when inventory enters, is sold (for latency or turnover analysis) |
| **distribution_centers** | Locations of logistics / warehouses | `id` (PK), `name`, `latitude`, `longitude` | Useful for spatial analysis: distance to user, delivery modeling, logistics cost |
| **events** | Web / site user events (browse, add-to-cart, purchase) | `event_id` (PK), `user_id` (FK ‚Üí users), `sequence_number`, `event_type` (view, add_to_cart, purchase, etc.), `product_id`, `created_at`, `traffic_source`, `user_agent` | For funnel analysis, attribution, user behavior flow |

# Entity Relationship Model

![TheLook Ecommerce ER Model](../../../images/thelook_ecommerce_er_model.jpeg)

## üìä Derived Metrics / Business Concepts

Here are some core metrics or dimensions you can derive from this dataset:

- **Revenue** = sum of `sale_price` in `order_items` for non-cancelled orders  
- **Units Sold** = sum of `quantity` in `order_items`  
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** = total revenue / number of orders  
- **Repeat Purchase Rate** = percentage of users with >1 order  
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** = sum of future revenue from user (if model)  
- **Churn / Inactivity** = users who haven‚Äôt purchased in last **X** days  
- **Product category performance**: revenue, units by `products.category`  
- **Geographic performance** by `country`, `city`, or distance to distribution center  
- **Funnel metrics**: view ‚Üí add_to_cart ‚Üí purchase via `events`  
- **Return rate**: proportion of order_items or orders marked ‚ÄúReturned‚Äù (if status exists)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Assumptions

- The data is **synthetic / fictitious**, with no real user identities or personally identifiable data. Use it only for learning, prototyping, and portfolio work. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Some timestamps may have **inconsistencies or anomalies** (e.g., negative durations) as noted in explorations. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Some columns may have null or missing values (e.g. city, lat/long).  
- The dataset is **static** ‚Äì it is not continuously updated; thus it serves best for historical analysis, tests, or modeling, not real-time production.  
- Joins are presumed to be many-to-one or one-to-many; be careful with cardinality especially in events or order_items.  
- Be cautious with performance: querying large joins can consume many bytes, so filter early, pick columns, and use query cost estimates in BigQuery.
